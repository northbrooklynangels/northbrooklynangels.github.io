&amp;ldquo;People need to eat. And helping someone eat, whether it&amp;rsquo;s with your family sitting down or with your friends or with your neighbors, it&amp;rsquo;s a gesture where people smile, they&amp;rsquo;re nourished and it creates good will,&amp;rdquo; Sheehan said.
Nourishing people&amp;rsquo;s bodies while also nourishing his native Greenpoint has always been Sheehan&amp;rsquo;s top priority.</description></item></channel></rss>

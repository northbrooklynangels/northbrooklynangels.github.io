North Brooklyn Angels a the place where newer & long term residents come together in support of helping food and economically insecure neighbors in volunteer projects! 

# Volunteer!

North Brooklyn Angels is **95% volunteer-powered**! Everything from driving our trucks, to packaging hundreds of meals, to helping sort and distribute clothing to families in need, is done by our amazing volunteers. We rely on people every day to help us cook & clean in the kitchen and to serve meals from our fleet of mobile soup kitchen vehicles. 

Below is our menu of ways to get involved as a volunteer! There’s a strong likelihood that there’s something for almost everyone!

* **Meal packing shifts**: Volunteer for a shift (or two)! We pack hundreds of hot meals for distribution around North Brooklyn 5 days a week. If you're new to volunteering with us, this is a great place to start! [Sign up for a shift through Deed](http://bit.ly/nbadeed). Once you've done so, look up North Brooklyn Angels to sign up for upcoming shifts!
* **Micro-but-crucial volunteer opportunities**: Beyond our regular meal-packing shifts, we have a variety of volunteer needs occurring throughout the week. [You can view our current needs and sign up via this form!](https://airtable.com/app9GV4yqmD36zBzq/pagLc0q9H8yNgFMFx/form)

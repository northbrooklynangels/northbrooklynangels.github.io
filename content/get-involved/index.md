Our goal is to be the place where newer & long term residents come together in support of feeding insecure neighbors in volunteer projects which aid members of our community struggling with economic change. Serving meals is only the beginningâ€¦

# Volunteer!

North Brooklyn Angels is **95% volunteer-powered**! Everything from driving our trucks, packaging hundreds of meals, to helping sort and distribute clothing to families in need, is done by our amazing volunteers. We rely on people every day to help us cook & clean in the kitchen and to serve meals from our fleet of mobile soup kitchen vehicles. 

Below is our menu of ways to get involved as a volunteer! There's a strong likelihood that there's something for almost everyone!

* **Weekday lunch shifts:** Volunteer for a shift (or two)! We pack hundreds of hot meals for distribution around North Brooklyn 5 days a week. If you're new to volunteering with us, this is a great place to start! Sign up for a shift through [Deed](http://bit.ly/nbadeed), and once you've done so, look up North Brooklyn Angels to see the upcoming shifts!
* **Micro-but-crucial volunteer opportunities:** Beyond our regular meal-packing shifts, we have a variety of volunteer needs occurring throughout the week. [You can view our current needs and sign up via this form](https://airtable.com/app9GV4yqmD36zBzq/pagLc0q9H8yNgFMFx/form)!
* **Little Angels:** We have officially launched our newest initiative, Little Angels! We're working on bridging the gap between North Brooklyn families with more resources and families in need during the early years of parenting. [Learn more and support our mission here.](/little-angels)

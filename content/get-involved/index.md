Every day, North Brooklyn Angels serves hundreds of hot meals to neighbors facing food insecurity across North Brooklyn. We bring together newer and long-term residents in meaningful volunteer work that supports community members navigating economic challenges. Serving meals is just the beginning of building stronger neighborhoods together.

# Jump In: Start Volunteering Today

North Brooklyn Angels is 95% volunteer-powered! From driving our mobile soup kitchens to packaging meals and distributing clothing to families in need, our amazing volunteers make it all possible. We need people every day to help cook and clean in our kitchen and serve meals from our fleet of vehicles.

Ready to get involved? Here's how you can make a difference:

## Meal Packing Shifts (Perfect for New Volunteers!)

Sign up for your first shift! We pack hundreds of hot meals for distribution around North Brooklyn six days a week (Monday through Friday plus Sunday). Each shift runs 2-3 hours and is a great way to meet fellow volunteers while making an immediate impact.

**Get started**: [Create an account with Deed](http://bit.ly/nbadeed), then search for "North Brooklyn Angels" to sign up for upcoming shifts.

## Quick-Impact Volunteer Opportunities

Beyond our regular meal-packing shifts, we have ongoing volunteer needs throughout the week—from supporting our kitchen to driving one of our vehicles.

## Little Angels Program

Our newest program bridges the gap between North Brooklyn families with resources and families in need during the early years of parenting.

## Corporate & Group Volunteering

**Update**: As of Fall 2025, we've shifted our focus to prioritize local individual volunteer sign-ups and support for our existing partners and donors. We're no longer hosting regular corporate volunteer groups or team events.

However, large corporate teams are welcome to join us at our [**Angel Babies pop-up events**](/angel-babies), which happen twice a year—once in the Spring and once in the Fall. 

We're excited to reignite our upcoming Fall event at the end of October!

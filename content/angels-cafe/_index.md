## A Partnership Reignited
Angels Cafe first opened its doors in 2022 as a cause marketing partner with North Brooklyn Angels. In 2025, new owner Albert Lee - bagel artisan and owner of Montague Bagels in Brooklyn Heights - took over with a fresh vision: quality bagels that serve the community.

Albert brings both his culinary expertise and his personal commitment to giving back. A portion of Angels Cafe's profits directly supports North Brooklyn Angels programs, making every purchase an act of community care.

## Comfort Meets Chaos
Albert's menu balances beloved classics with bold, experimental creations. From traditional Sausage, Egg & Cheese to the innovative Bulgogi bagel sandwich honoring his Korean heritage, there's something for every palate - and every bite supports our mission.

Since 2020, North Brooklyn Angels has hosted **Neighbors Giving Thanks**, a volunteer-driven, multi-day event that brings together over 100 local volunteers to ensure our neighbors in Bushwick, Greenpoint, and Williamsburg experience a joyous and dignified Thanksgiving, regardless of means or circumstances.

**The affordability crisis in New York City continues to impact our neighbors.** As grocery costs remain high and many families struggle to make ends meet, a dignified Thanksgiving shouldn't be a luxury. Whether it's a turkey to prepare at home or a warm, restaurant-style meal served with care, every neighbor deserves to gather and give thanks.

# We need your support to make this happen again in 2025! 

With sustained high costs for food and turkeys, your donation will make a real difference in our community. Please consider giving and spreading the word to keep our "neighbors helping neighbors" motto alive.

# What We're Planning for November 2025:

* **1,000 frozen turkeys** distributed to local families who have the means to cook at home but need support affording a holiday meal
* **Over 1,000 holiday meals** prepared and distributed at our regular community locations from Monday through Wednesday before Thanksgiving
* **Almost 600 sit-down, restaurant-style Thanksgiving meals** served at four North Brooklyn locations, creating safe, welcoming spaces where neighbors can celebrate together—with pickup options available for those who prefer freshly packaged meals

# Two Ways to Celebrate, One Goal: Dignity for All

We recognize that our neighbors have different needs and circumstances. Some have kitchens and the ability to cook but can't afford a turkey. Others may not have cooking facilities, live alone, or simply want the experience of a communal celebration. That's why we offer both options—because choice itself is a form of dignity.

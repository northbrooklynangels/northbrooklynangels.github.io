Responding to community need and opportunities made possible by local partnerships and volunteer support, Angel Babies elevates our vision of “neighbors helping neighbors” as we mount big volunteer-driven giveaway events to local, new and expectant families who are in need of resources.

Each time a campaign is ignited, for a few weeks, North Brooklyn businesses, schools, bars, cafes, and large apartment buildings sign on to host donation collections for this incredible giveaway event, netting thousands of Angel Babies donations!

# New Program: Little Angels
